# The Reinforcement Learning Lab

## Why this project?

I like learning about various fields of mathematics and computer science, with a particular bias towards artificially intelligent algorithms. Therefore it would be nice to store all the knowledge I have gathered so far during my learning journey.

Therefore, this repo was created to store stuffs learned in reinforcement learning which describes a set of algorithms that aims at reinforcing a certain behaviour from an agent by assigning feedbacks to the action it takes over time. Not the best definition but... don't wanna spend too much time on this ReadMe.

## What is included on this project?

- ‚úçÔ∏è Personal [notes](/notes) from [books](/notes/books) and [papers](/notes/papers) read. I recommend reading them through [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to easily navigate through the notes.
- The Python library üìö for this project [rl_lab](/rl_lab/) that contains implementation of  different algorithms learnt and re-usable components to perform reduntant tasks such as politting graphs and training agents.
- Python [notebooks](/notebooks) üìì that demonstrated the concepts learned with visualizations included as much as possible.

## Set Up Environment

There are certain steps you need to do to be able to run the notebooks. 

Assuming you have a suitable [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) environment at your disposal, please run the following commands.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

And that's it. Now you can run all the notebooks of this project.

## Usage

If you want to use the functions from the library, you can easily do that by importing the library in your python file or notebook.

Here is am

```python
from rl_lab.agents.bandits import Jumper
from rl_lab.environments.bandits import LineWalkEnvironment

allowed_jumps = [-5, -1, 1, 5]
timesteps = 40
max_line_length = 256

environment = LineWalkEnvironment(max_line_legnth)
agent = Jumper(allowed_jumps, timesteps, environment)
```

## Contributions

Since these are personal notes, I do not expect any addition of new algorithms. However, feel free to raise an issue if you spotted an error somewhere or just wish to discuss about a particular concept implemented in this project.
