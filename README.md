# The Reinforcement Learning Lab

### Why this repo?

I like learning about various fields of mathematics and computer science, with a particular bias towards artificially intelligent algorithms. Therefore it would be nice to store all the knowledge I have gathered so far during my learning journey.

Therefore, this repo was created to store stuffs learned in reinforcement learning which describes a set of algorithms that aims at reinforcing a certain behaviour from an agent by assigning feedbacks to the action it takes over time. Not the best definition but... don't wanna spend too much time on this ReadMe.

### What is included on this project?

- Personal [notes](https://github.com/ArnolFokam/reinforcement-learning-lab/tree/main/notes) from [books](https://github.com/ArnolFokam/reinforcement-learning-lab/tree/main/notes/books) and [papers](https://github.com/ArnolFokam/reinforcement-learning-lab/tree/main/notes/papers) read. I recommend reading them through [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to easily navigate through the notes.
